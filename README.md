# 🏡 House Price Prediction - Linear Regression

This project implements **Simple and Multiple Linear Regression** models to predict housing prices using `housing.csv` data.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Understand and implement **Linear Regression** using scikit-learn.
- Predict house prices based on features such as area, bedrooms, and bathrooms.
- Visualize the regression line for simple linear regression.
- Evaluate the model using common regression metrics.

## 📁 Dataset

The project uses `housing.csv`, which contains features like:

- `area` – Area in square feet
- `bedrooms` – Number of bedrooms
- `bathrooms` – Number of bathrooms
- `price` – Target variable (house price)
